# Advanced Campus Network Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an **Advanced Campus Area Network** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It integrates multiple networking concepts such as VLANs, routing protocols, access control lists (ACLs), and security configurations to ensure secure and reliable communication across departments.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a scalable and secure campus area network.
- Implement inter-VLAN routing and network segmentation.
- Configure dynamic routing protocols (OSPF/RIP) for efficient communication.
- Ensure network security with ACLs and device hardening.
- Validate connectivity and functionality through simulation.

## 🖥️ Network Topology
- Core, distribution, and access layer design.
- VLANs implemented on switches for traffic segmentation.
- Routers and Layer 3 switches for inter-VLAN routing.
- DHCP for automatic IP addressing.
- ACLs for controlled access.

## ⚙️ Key Configurations
- **VLANs:** Departmental traffic segmentation.
- **Routing Protocols:** OSPF and/or RIP for dynamic routing.
- **DHCP:** Automatic IP allocation.
- **ACLs:** Restrict unauthorized access.
- **Security:** Password encryption, SSH, and device hardening.

## ✅ Testing & Results
- End-to-end connectivity verified using ping tests.
- Routing table validation for dynamic route propagation.
- ACL testing to confirm restricted traffic policies.
- Network successfully achieved design requirements.
